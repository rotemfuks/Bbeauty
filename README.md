## Important

This was a finals project and most of the features that are using the api calls will not work because the backend and the database was in mad up data base. if you want to run all the features you need to run this command in the terminal (json-server --watch db.json --port 8000).

### Installation
1.Clone this repository: git clone.
2.Navigate to the project directory.
3.Install the dependencies: npm install


### Usage
1.run this command "json-server --watch db.json --port 8000".
2.run npm start.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
